# Glass-Kiln-Controller
A controller unit used to execute a firing schedule for glass fusing in an old ceramic kiln.
The reason I do this :
  An old ceramic kiln has the internal height to be able to make tall objects1.1. -
  I want to be able to program and control the kiln via my smart phone
  It is a challenging and interesting project
  
The project consists of 1 Omega2+ processor for high level programming, User Interface and connection to ioT
An arduino UNO processor to take care of the low level programming, interfacing with the hardware

Thus the repository will have at least 2 main branches:  
  One for the Arduino part (c++ code)
  One for the Omega2+ part (Python code)
